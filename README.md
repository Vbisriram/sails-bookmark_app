# sails-bookmark_app


Description : This is a sample application for bookmark maintenance using Sails .


        This is my first complete application development . Started this development as a part of
assignment but got bit interested in sails and angular which  inspired me to create a complete application
and see its working . Hope i will see ;)



        I am Completely new to Javascript . Before this i know Javascript just as a client side language which can be used
 for a form validation and those stuffs. But it looks simple to use and more flexible to use than any languages as of i known.
 Only I gonna read this but still i breif my work for my future purpose :P ;)

                  Seeing Javascript as a server side using nodejs is really intersting .


                  (An interesting question   " Why The Hell Would I Use Node.js? " which is well answered by
                    totpal http://www.toptal.com/nodejs/why-the-hell-would-i-use-node-js )

Major Advantages of using nodejs :

1. Easy to modify and maintain
2. Productivity
3. Rapid-Innovation and Delivery
4. High-Performance

Performance proof of nodejs :

        PayPal reported: double the number of requests per-second and reduced response time by 35% or 200 milliseconds.
